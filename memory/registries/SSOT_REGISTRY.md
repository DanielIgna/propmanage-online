# SSOT REGISTRY

**Artifact Type**: REGISTRY
**Owner**: Fondator (danieligna1@gmail.com)
**Last Review**: 2026-02-06
**Schema**: Topic · OwnerDocument · AuthorityTier · Status · LastReview · Notes
**Purpose**: Enumerates the Single-Source-of-Truth mapping for every governance topic on PropManage. For any listed topic, the row's `OwnerDocument` is the canonical statement — any other document that references the topic must defer to it.

> This registry does not contain narrative prose. It contains structured facts. To add a new topic: (1) verify no equivalent SSOT already exists in this registry; (2) confirm the OwnerDocument is Active and Approved; (3) append a row respecting the schema; (4) bump `Last Review`.

## Schema Fields

| Field | Description |

| Topic | The subject of the SSOT statement. Short, canonical noun-phrase. |

| Status | `Active` · `Draft` · `Deprecated`. Only `Active` rows are canonical. |

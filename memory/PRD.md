# PropManage — Product Requirements Document

## Original problem statement
PropManage is a full-stack property management platform with: Digital Twin 3D viewer, Multi-Role auth, QA Automation, marketplace for specialists, GDPR/Trust Center, AI Console, support inbox, auth-health dashboard.

## Recent additions (Feb 2026)
- **Phase 64 — Verified Estate (Imobile Verificate) ETAPA 1** ✅
  - New isolated module: `routes/verified_estate.py` + frontend `/imobile-verificate`
  - 4 quality gates enforced (audit_report_id + digital_twin_id + ≥90% recommendations + admin approval)
  - Public browse page with filters (city, rooms, price_max)
  - Detail page with gallery, Twin embed slot, audit PDF, inquiry form (viewing/buy)
  - External audit request flow (Traseu C — buyer found property elsewhere)
  - Admin endpoints (stats, listings, inquiries, external requests) — role-gated
  - 2 demo listings seeded (Aviatorilor + Pipera) with 100% recommendations accepted
  - Feature flag: `FEATURE_VERIFIED_ESTATE=true` in backend/.env
  - "Imobile Verificate" menu link added in nav
  - Commission strategy: 2.5% (Digital Twin cost deducted as bonus on completion)
  - Tested: public browse + detail + inquiry + external-audit + admin stats all 200 OK

- Earlier phases:
  - Trimble Connect SKP iframe viewer
  - Blender 3.4 headless DAE/OBJ/FBX → GLB conversion
  - Google OAuth resilience (K8s ingress timeout fix)
  - `/admin/auth-health` dashboard with sparklines + email alerts
  - Support contact form + `/admin/support-inbox`
  - Public `/demo` 3D showcase
  - Postinstall `patch-visual-edits.js` for R3F crash fix

## Tech stack
- Backend: FastAPI + MongoDB (motor) + APScheduler
- Frontend: React 19 + react-router 7 + framer-motion + Tailwind + lucide-react
- 3D: Three.js (@react-three/fiber) + Trimble Connect iframe + Blender subprocess
- Integrations: Resend (email), Stripe (payments), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (LLM), Google OAuth

## Verified Estate — architectural decisions
- Single tab in main PropManage app (NOT a separate site)
- All routes prefixed `/api/verified-estate/*`
- New collections (zero impact on existing): `verified_estate_listings`, `verified_estate_inquiries`, `verified_estate_external_requests`
- Feature flag controls entire module (rollback in 5 sec)
- 4 Gates enforced in API code, cannot be bypassed:
  1. Audit report required
  2. Digital Twin required
  3. ≥90% recommendations accepted
  4. Admin manual approval (status=published)

## Roadmap (next phases)
- **ETAPA 2 — Seller flow & Admin moderation**
  - Stripe checkout for audit + Twin (configurable price)
  - SellMyProperty wizard with gate enforcement
  - Admin Kanban moderation panel: Draft → Pending Review → Published
  - Email notifications on inquiry/external-audit creation
- **ETAPA 3 — Trust & Polish**
  - Unified button system (CSS tokens) across all pages
  - Map view with Leaflet pins
  - Trust Score A+/A/B/C calculator
- **ETAPA 4 — Scale**
  - Sale ↔ Rent toggle
  - Recommendations engine
- **Other backlog**
  - Aspose.3D Cloud SKP→GLB direct integration
  - Twilio SMS critical-night alerts
  - Lottie animations for KB

## Test credentials
Admin: `admin@propmanage.io` / `Admin123!`

## Known infrastructure issues (outside codebase)
- `propmanage.ro` DNS Zone Editor in Rackhost cPanel showing "DNS Zone Failed to Load" — user contacting Rackhost support; DNS A records currently missing for root domain (visible in dns.google query as empty Answer). Deployment to Emergent.host works fine.

## Key files
- `/app/backend/routes/verified_estate.py` (NEW — ETAPA 1)
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/verified-estate/EstateBrowse.jsx` (NEW)
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/verified-estate/EstateDetail.jsx` (NEW)
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/verified-estate/SellMyProperty.jsx` (NEW — landing placeholder)
- `/app/backend/server.py` (registered router + seed hook)
- `/app/frontend/src/App.js` (3 new routes + nav link)

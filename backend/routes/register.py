"""Central router registry — all API routers in registration order.

server.py imports ALL_ROUTERS from here and includes them in order.
When adding a new route module, append its router(s) HERE (not in server.py)
and remember to classify the module in an admin zone (see
frontend/src/config/adminZones.js — business vs infrastructure).
